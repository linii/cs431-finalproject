# (CS431: Computer Music) final project

## Overview

## Running with GUI

1. Boot server.
2. Evaluate: `doik.scd`, `grid.scd`, `instrument.scd`, `samples.scd`, `player.scd`
3. Evaluate `gui.scd`
4. The GUI is designed to faciliate semi-live production of music. The grid will not update live, but you can:
    - pause and add new doiks
    - drop new doiks as the music is playing, initiated with a random direction.
    - dynamically change the bpm

## Sounds

can be found under the `sounds/` folder.
